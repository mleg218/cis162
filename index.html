    <h1><b>Matthew Legaspi</b></h1>
    <p>I'm Matt, and I am a first year Computer Science student.  I got my first experience with HTML when I had a blog and wanted to customize the format of it, and later on I got interested in modding video games and learned a little about code.  Over time, I realized that I liked tinkering with programs and customizing my devices with programming knowledge, and I decided I wanted to learn more about Computer Science. Hopefully I can use this knowledge for jobs in IT and my own hobbies.  Ideally, I would love to work with video games in any capacity, whether it is programming or something involved in playtesting.</p>
    <h2><b>When I have free time :</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I play and stream myself playing video games.</li>
        <li>I practice drumming.</li>
        <li>I work on my car.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My favorite website is <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> as a source of entertainment as well as a source for tutorials for almost anything.</p>
